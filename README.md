Predicting the House Sale Prices in King County, WA. USA.
- This project aims to predict house sale prices in King County, Washington, by analyzing various property features. The project discusses the data structure, preprocessing techniques, and a methodology that involves several regression models. The dataset consists of 21 variables and 21613 observations. After preprocessing, 13 predictors are left, with no missing values or duplicates. The study uses both linear and nonlinear models and concludes that the Principal Components Regression (PCR) model is the best among linear models, while the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model is the best among nonlinear models. The SVM model outperforms the rest with the lowest RMSE and higher R-squared on the test set. Therefore, it is recommended to use the SVM model for predicting housing prices in King County.
- Note: For this gitub version only 700 observations were used to reduce computation time.
